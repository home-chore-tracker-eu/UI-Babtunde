MineChore is an app that is built to help you overcome the struggle of getting your kids to perform their household chores. It is an open secret that so many parents have to scream at the top of their voice whenever they need the bins to be emptied or the the dishwasher loaded. Also, there are times when your kids claim to have done what have not been done. MineChore helps you detect all these dubious claims. 

This app let's you know which of your kid performs most when it comes to carying out household duties. Points are assigned based on the nature and weight of chore performed. Hence, it is easier to single out a particular child for rewards and compensation.
